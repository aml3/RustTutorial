ptitle Example of using the title tag
phead 1 This is an example heading
phead 4 Notice how the number determines the degree
Normal text is straightforward, as is code from a file.
scode False {'loc': 'code/collatz.rs', 'range': False, 'lang': 'rust'}
A blank line creates a new paragraph.

Now for code embedded
scode False {'lang': 'rust'}
code
let x = 5;
edoc
in text!

Another embedding
scode False {'lang': 'rust'}
code
let x = 5;
let y = 4;
edoc
in text!

This next bit shows the improved tabs, as well as how to embed highlighted code
which isn't from a file. The empty dictionary is currently necessary because
I'm lazy.
scode True {}
rcode
let x = 4; // uses the compiler default
let y: uint = 4; // forces y to be an unsigned integer
let z: i32 = 4; // forces z to be a 32-bit integer
edocr
jcode
int x = 4; // uses the compiler default
// Java doesn't have unsigned ints
int z = 4; // depends on the machine
edocj
There is, of course, the option also to embed highlighted blocks without tabs.
scode False {'lang': 'rust'}
codeb
let no: ~str = ~"yes";
