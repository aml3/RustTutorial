phead 1 Starting to Corrode:<br>Pointers, Memory, Strings, and I/O
pnav 01.html 03.html
This section of the tutorial introduces one of the "rustiest" aspects of Rust: memory management.  

Rust provides memory references in a way that is quite different from other languages you may be familiar with, and it requires some effort to understand, but provide the big advantage of providing both explicit control and safety. We'll also cover strings and vectors, file and user I/O, and basic error handling in Rust. At the end of this section, you'll write a simple encryption program that employs many of the new concepts.

phead 2 Memory Management
phead 3 Boxes
The <em>box</em> in Rust is the fundamental abstraction of memory. References in Rust can point to boxes.  Because Rust is designed to emphasize safety, any allocated memory in Rust is <em>boxed</em>, and thus any box can be thought of as simply a chunk of memory. 
phead 3 Pointer Types
Rust provides two main pointer types: the <em>owned</em> pointer (indicated by the tilde:
scode
~
edoc
) and the <em>borrowed</em> reference (denoted with ampersand: 
scode
&
edoc
). Both kinds of pointers point to a box, and the pointer types are orthogonal to the type of data the box contains. For example,
scode
~[&str]
edoc
is a owned reference to a vector of borrowed strings.

Similarly, dereferencing a Rust pointer is done with the star operator ( 
scode
*
edoc
 ). The next section on ownership will go into more detail on the usage and interaction of both of these.
<div class="note">
Note: Legacy Rust code (before 0.9) also has a "managed pointer" represented by the 
scode
@
edoc
 which was automatically managed (garbage collected). As of Rust 0.9, this syntax is deprecated, however it is planned to be reintroduced in future releases. These added a deal of simplicity to pointer management, however other pointer types could be used with more efficency.  Automatically managed pointers may be implemented as library types.
</div>

phead 3 Ownership

In Rust, there is a notion of <em>ownership</em> of an object.  The owner of an
object, which could be a variable that refers to that object, manages
the object's lifetime (that is, when its memory is allocated and
reclaimed).  Programmers do not have to explicitly allocated and
deallocate storage.  Rather, it is done by the Rust compiler and runtime
based on how the object references are used.

phead 4 Owned Boxes
A declaration of an owned (
scode
~
edoc
) pointer can be thought of as giving the declared variable ownership of the box.  What does this mean in code? The following block works as anticipated, printing out "10".
scode False {'lang': 'rust'}
codeb
    let x = ~10;
    println!("{:d}", *x);
bedoc
However the following block gives a compilation error:
scode False {'lang': 'rust'}
codeb
    let x = ~10;
    let y = x;
    println!("{:d}", *x);
bedoc
<pre><code>tut2.rs:3:23: 3:24 <span style="color:red;">error:</span> use of moved value: `x`
tut2.rs:3     println!("{:d}", *x);
</code></pre>
The error message is a bit unclear, but what it is reporting is a violation of ownership rules.  When we create the owned box of 
scode
~10
edoc
, that box is owned by the variable
scode
x
edoc
. The initialization,
scode
let y = x;
edoc
assigns the <em>pointer</em> to y. Because of Rust's emphasis on safety this is not allowed: it creates two references to an owned box.  

In other languages, such as C and Java, there are no restrictions on pointer sharing.  We could do, <!-- markup do distinguish C/Rust code? -->
scode
    y = x;
    *y = 3;
edoc
thus changing the value of
scode
*x
edoc
through the alias.  With Rust, the assignment, 
scode
y = x
edoc
<em>transfers</em> ownership of the box 
scode
x 
edoc
refers to from the 
scode
x 
edoc
reference to the 
scode
y 
edoc
reference.  From this point on, any attempts to use 
scode
x
edoc
to manipulate that box will result in a compiler error.

We can make a copy of a box using the 
scode
clone
edoc
 method which copies over the content of a box and creates a new owned pointer to the copy. So the following code will assign 
scode
y
edoc
 to a new owned pointer pointing to a new copy of the value "10". The dereferencing of 
scode
x
edoc
 no longer causes a compiler error, as 
scode
x
edoc
 still has proper ownership of its box.
scode False {'lang': 'rust'}
codeb
    let x = ~10;
    let y = x.clone();
    println!("{:d}", *x);
bedoc
But, 
scode
x
edoc
and 
scode
y
edoc
refer to different boxes now &mdash; a modification of 
scode
*x
edoc
will not be visible through 
scode
y
edoc
.

phead 4 Borrowed References

All that copying would be expensive, and eliminate the benefits of data
sharing for uses like pass-by-reference and data structures.  Rust's
solution is to provide a way for owners to loan out their objects.  

Using the 
scode
&
edoc
 operator creates a temporary reference to some memory that has already been allocated. These references are refered to as "borrowed" because they can access the contents of the box during the borrowing period, but do not own the box. This most commonly used to pass in a pointer reference to a method.

Because of Rust's emphasis on safety there are many resctriction on what can be done with a reference. Most notably, if a pointer has a borrowed reference in scope (more on scope in the next section), any function which would free the memory or change the type being pointed to would cause a compile-time error. Think of it this way: creating a reference to a box "lends" that box's contents to the reference until the loaned box is "returned".  Thus, a reference owner gives up full control over a loaned box while it is being borrowed.

Borrowed references are frequently used as function parameters.  For example,
scode False {'lang': 'rust'}
codeb
fn borrow(r : &int) -> int {
    *r
}
bedoc
declares the function 
scode
borrow
edoc
to take a borrowed pointer to an int.  We can call it by passing in an owned pointer:
scode False {'lang': 'rust'}
codeb
    let x = ~10;
    println!("borrow(x): {:d}", borrow(x));
bedoc
Borrowed pointers can also be loaned by the borrowee, within the lifetime of the original loan.  We can pass in an owned pointer to borrow2, which borrows that pointer and passes it as a borrowed pointer to borrow:
scode False {'lang': 'rust'}
codeb
fn borrow2(r : &int) -> int {
   borrow(r)
}
bedoc

phead 4 Pointer Mutability
As with scalar variables, boxes are immutable by default.  The 
scode
mut
edoc
qualifier is used to indicate that a box is mutable.  Mutability applies to the <em>contents</em> of a box, and not the pointer itself.

For example,
scode False {'lang': 'rust'}
codeb
fn increment(r: &int) {
    *r = *r + 1;
}
bedoc
is not permitted:
<pre><code>
borrowed.rs:2:4: 2:6 <span style="color:red;">error:</span> cannot assign to immutable dereference of & pointer
borrowed.rs:2     *r = *r + 1;
                   ^~
</code></pre>
To allow the modification, we need to declare the parameter as a borrowed, mutable reference:
scode
r: &mut int
edoc
Now, the compiler produces an error for the callsite since the passed object is not mutable:
<pre><code>
borrowed.rs:16:14: 16:15 <span style="color:red;">error:</span> cannot borrow immutable dereference of ~ pointer as mutable
borrowed.rs:16     increment(x);
</code></pre>

To change this, we need to add 
scode
mut
edoc
to the declaration:
scode False {'lang': 'rust'}
codeb
fn main() {
    let mut x = ~10;
    increment(x);
bedoc

The 
scode
mut
edoc
here applies to the reference 
scode
x
edoc
and is also inherited by the box (so no separate 
scode
mut
edoc
annotation is needed for the 
scode
~
edoc
.  It allows both the variable 
scode
x
edoc
to be reassigned, as well as the contents of the owned box to be modified:
scode False {'lang': 'rust'}
codeb
    let mut x = ~10;
    x = ~20;
    *x = 30;
bedoc

The first assignment statement creates a new box owned by 
scode
x
edoc
holding the value
scode
20
edoc
. The second assignment statement modifies the value in that box to be
scode
30
edoc
.  Without the 
scode
mut
edoc
neither assignment would be permitted by the Rust compiler.

Borrowed references do not inherit mutability.  For example, this code is invalid:
scode False {'lang': 'rust'}
codeb
    let mut val1 = 10;
    let mut val2 = 20;
    let mut borrowed = &val1;
    borrowed = &val2;
    *borrowed = 11;
bedoc
<pre><code>
borrowed.rs:23:4: 23:13 <span style="color:red;">error:</span> cannot assign to immutable dereference of & pointer
borrowed.rs:23     *borrowed = 11;
                   <span style="color:red;">^~~~~~~~~</span>
</code></pre>
To allow both modifications, we need:
scode False {'lang': 'rust'}
codeb
    let mut borrowed = &mut val1;
bedoc
 which allows both modifying the referenced box and changing what 
scode
borrowed
edoc
 references. 

Keep in mind that references are type checked (yet another safety measure of Rust!) so the following code produces an error at compile time due to trying to reassign an int reference to a float reference.
scode False {'lang': 'rust'}
codeb
    let mut val1 = 10;
    let mut val3 = 10.0;
    let borrowed = &val1;
    borrowed = &val3;
bedoc
<pre><code>tut2.rs:4:16: 6:21 <span style="color:red;">error:</span> mismatched types: expected `&&lt;VI0&gt;` but found `&&lt;VF0&gt;` (expected integral variable but found floating-point variable)
tut2.rs:4     borrowed = &val3;
</code></pre>

phead 4 Freezing Objects

When an object is loaned through a borrowed reference, the lender loses
the ability to modify that object.  This is especially important for
multi-tasking (which we'll get to soon), but still relevant with a
single thread.

For example, the following program produces a compiler error: 
scode False {'lang': 'rust'}
codeb
    let mut x = 10;
    {
        let y = &x;
        x = 11; // Error
    }
    x = 12; //This is fine
bedoc

<pre><code>example.rs:4:9: 4:10 <span style="color:red;">error:</span> cannot assign to `x` because it is borrowed
example.rs:4         x = 11;
</code></pre>

When the reference 
scode
y
edoc
 borrows the value 
scode
x
edoc
refers to, the value of 
scode
x
edoc
 is frozen until the reference to it goes out of scope. Thus, the first reassignment here is invalid, but the second (after 
scode
y
edoc
is out of scope) is fine.

phead 3 Lifetimes
Memory allocated in Rust is automatically freed when its owner either goes out of scope or is reassigned. This eliminates the need to explicitly free storage (as in C or C++), but guarantees safety without giving up control to a garbage collector.  

Owned pointers follow similar rules of deallocation, so borrowing a reference to some box and trying to access it once it has gone out of scope throws a compiler error.
scode False {'lang': 'rust'}
codeb
    let mut reference: &~int;
    {
        let val: ~int = ~10;
        reference = &val;
    } //val deallocated here
    println!("{:d}", **reference); //Referencing something that's gone!
bedoc
<pre><code>example.rs:4:21: 4:25 <span style="color:red;">error:</span> borrowed value does not live long enough
example.rs:4         reference = &val;
</code></pre>

phead 2 Vectors and Strings

Rust provides built-in vector and string types, consistent with Rust's focus on safety.

phead 4 Vectors

<a name="vectors"></a>
A vector is defined by using comma seperated values within brackets. 

A specific element can be accessed via 
scode
foo[index]
edoc
. Any vector definition where the elements may change after the initial definition should be an owned box, so the methods of
plink http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/0.9/std/vec/trait.OwnedVector.html std::vec::OwnedVector
 may be used to mutate the vector. 

These examples show simple vector functions:

scode False {'lang': 'rust'}
codeb
    let mut vec = ~[0, 1, 2];
    vec.push(3); // Appends to end: [0, 1, 2, 3]

    vec.insert(2, 10); 
    // Inserts 10 at position 2: [0, 1, 10, 2, 3]

    let last = vec.pop(); 
    // Returns last element, removing it from the vector: [0, 1, 10, 2]

    let element1 = vec.remove(1); 
    // Returns and removes element at specified index: [0, 10, 2]

    // An iterator for going through all elements in order: 
    for &x in vec.iter() { // note the use of & for borrowing
        println!("{}", x);
    }
    
    // len() returns the number of elements in the vector
    for i in range(0, vec.len()) { 
        println!("{}", vec[i]);
    }
bedoc
phead 4 Strings

Rust supposrts a 
scdoe
string
edoc
type which is a vector of characters.  Each character is a UTF-8 sequence, represented by the
scode
u8
edoc
type in Rust.

A notable construct that is very important for strings is the 
scode
slice
edoc
. This represents a view into a string, but not a string itself. Its type is
scode
&string
edoc
.  
 
Methods that produce a slice include 
scode
slice(&self, begin: int, end: int)
edoc
, which returns a slice of characters between begin and end - 1, 
scode
slice_from(&self, begin: int)
edoc
, which returns a slice with first element from the index provided that continues to the end, and 
scode
slice_to(&self, end: int)
edoc
, which returns a slice starting at the beginning with final element from index end - 1. 

These slice methods produce an immutable values, so they cannot be modified. 

To do something such as taking a substring, a slice may be converted to an owned string via the
scode
to_owned(&self)
edoc
 method.  These slice methods work on any vector, but string manipulation is the most common use of slices.

Other notable string methods include 
scode
str::eq(&~str, &~str)
edoc
which checks two strings for bytewise equality, and 
scode
split(&self, char)
edoc
 which returns an iterator that splits the string the method is called on into slices delimited by the parameter character. 

For string concatenation, the 
scode
+
edoc
 operator is used. 

These methods are used in the example below:
scode False {'lang': 'rust'}
codeb
    let string = ~"This is a string";
    let subst1 = string.slice(10, 16).to_owned();
    let subst2 = string.slice_from(10).to_owned();
    println!("{}", std::str::eq(&subst1, &subst2));
    let doublesub = subst1 + subst2;
    println!("{}", doublesub);
    // Using split iterator to print word by word
    for tempstr in string.split(' ') {
        println!("{}", tempstr);
    }
    // Another useful function of the split iterator
    // collect() Creates a vector ~["This", "is", "a", "string"]
    let wordvec: ~[&str] = string.split(' ').collect(); 
    for &s in wordvec.iter() {
        println!("{}", s);
    }
bedoc

</div>


phead 2 Basic I/O
Rust handles file and user input/output using the 
plink http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/0.9/std/io/index.html std::io
 module. 

The most intuitive way to work with these is through the use of a 
plink http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/0.9/std/io/buffered/struct.BufferedReader.html BufferedReader, 
which will be explained more in depth in the following sections. Take note that many methods in 
scode
BufferedReader 
edoc
return vectors of bytes, not strings, so appropriate conversions may be necessary.

phead 3 Working with Standard Input (stdin)

Standard input is provided through 
scode
std::io::stdin
edoc
, and implemented by creating a buffered reader.  The following example (taken from the Rust documentation) prints out a series of lines from standard input, automatically stopping at the end of input. The 
scode
lines
edoc
 method returns an iterator that goes through each line until the end of imput.
scode False {'lang': 'rust'}
codeb
use std::io::buffered::BufferedReader;
use std::io::stdin;

fn main(){
    let mut stdin = BufferedReader::new(stdin());
    for line in stdin.lines() {
        print(line);
    }
}
bedoc
Reading line by line is a bit more difficult, as the 
scode
read_line
edoc
 method is of an 
scode
Option<~str>
edoc
 type. These option types are explained more in depth in the "Error Handling" section later on this page of the tutorial. The gist of it is the following though: a call to 
scode
read_line
edoc
 can either succeed or fail. Thus, when it is called, we need a match statement to determine if it succeeded (where it will return 
scode
line
edoc
 in the following example) or fail (which returns
scode
None
edoc
). The example code below reads in the next 5 lines from stdin, and prints them. If there are less than 5 lines, the loop ends without crashing the program.
scode False {'lang': 'rust'}
codeb
use std::io::buffered::BufferedReader;
use std::io::stdin;
fn main(){
    let mut stdin = BufferedReader::new(stdin());
    for i in range(0, 5) {
        match stdin.read_line() {
            Some(line) => {
                print(line);
            }
            None => {
                println("End of input!");
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
bedoc
phead 3 Files
The standard library functions for working with files in Rust are handled via the 
plink http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/0.9/std/io/fs/struct.File.html std::io::File
 module. This module contains methods for opening and writing to a file. 

A file is opened using
scode
Path
edoc
 objects, which are included in any Rust program by default. Creating a 
scode
Path
edoc
 object is done through 
scode
Path::new("path/to/file.foo")
edoc
. 

To simply open a new file for writing,
scode
File::create(&Path)
edoc
 is the simplest call. This returns an 
edoc
Option<File>
scode
 type
edoc
, so it must be matched to ensure that a file was successfully opened. 

The two most common ways to write to the file once opened are: <br>
scode
   File::write(&mut self, &[u8])
edoc
which writes a buffer of bytes to a file, and: <br>
scode
   File::write_str(&mut self, &str)
edoc
which writes a string to the file.

This example demonstrated opening a file for writing using both of these methods:
scode False {'lang': 'rust'}
codeb
use std::io::File;

fn main()
{
    match File::create(&Path::new("message.txt")) {
        Some(mut file) => {
            file.write(bytes!("line one\n"));
            file.write_str("line two\n");
        }
        None =>{
            println("Opening message.txt failed!");
        }
    }
}
bedoc
Reading a file can be accomplished easily through using the 
plink http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/0.9/std/io/buffered/struct.BufferedReader.html BufferedReader
 module, much like reading from standard in. 

Opening a file to a 
scode
BufferedReader
edoc
 is done using the 
scode
File::open(&Path)
edoc
 function, which opens the file at a given path in read-only mode, followed by 
scode
BufferedReader::new(File)
edoc
. 

Note that the file needs to be matched before converting to a 
scode
BufferedReader
edoc
, as 
scode
File::open
edoc
returns an 
scode
Option<File>
edoc
 type. Once converted to a 
scode
BufferedReader
edoc
, a file is read in an identical manner to reading from stdin in the previous example, and all relevant methods are outlined on the
plink http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/0.9/std/io/buffered/struct.BufferedReader.html BufferedReader
 documentation.

Here's a simple example of reading a file:

scode False {'lang': 'rust'}
codeb
use std::io::buffered::BufferedReader;
use std::io::File;

fn main()
{
    match File::open(&Path::new("message.txt")) {
        Some(file) => {
            let reader = BufferedReader::new(file);
            //reading from file
        }
        None =>{
            println("Opening message.txt failed!");
        }
    }
}
bedoc

The 
scode
File::open_mode(&Path, FileMode, FileAccess)
edoc
 method allows specifying the mode in which a file is accessed. 
scode
FileMode
edoc
 and 
scode
FileAccess
edoc
 are enumerable types imported from 
plink http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/0.9/std/io/enum.FileMode.html std::io::FileMode
 and 
plink http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/0.9/std/io/enum.FileAccess.html std::io::FileAccess
 respectively. For example, to open a file with read and write access, positioned to append to the end of the file, the following must be included, and then called as so.
scode False {'lang': 'rust'}
codeb
use std::io::{File, Append, ReadWrite};
/*
...
*/
let file = File::open_mode(&Path::new("message.txt"), Append, ReadWrite);
bedoc
Like the other file methods, this returns an
scode
Option
edoc
objects that must be matched to check for opening failures.

phead 2 Error Handling

Error handling in Rust is done with the intention of catching what can be caught at compile-time, and reducing runtime errors. We've seen the 
scode
Option<T>
edoc
 type used for functions which either create an object or fail (represented by 
scode
None()
edoc
). There is another, similar construct to this called a 
scode
Result<T,E>
edoc
 which is like a 
scode
Option
edoc
, but determined on whether a function succeds as intended on a pre-existing object (as opposed to the creation of a new object with 
scode
Option
edoc
). 

A 
scode
Result
edoc
 requires a match statement to use the values obtained. The 
scode
Ok(T)
edoc
 branch represents a successful call, whereas 
scode
Err(E)
edoc
 is a failed called. The error result may provide specific information about the failure, depending on the function.

If a 
scode
None()
edoc
 or 
scode
Err(E)
edoc
 branch is reached and the program can no longer continue, a 
scode
fail!()
edoc
 macro can be used to terminate a program with an optional message. 

The following code terminates with a message if "foo.txt" is failed to open:
scode False {'lang': 'rust'}
codeb
match File::create(&Path::new("foo.txt")) {
    Some(mut file) => { /* ... */ }
    None => {
      fail!("Creating foo.txt failed!");
    }
}
bedoc
phead 2 Example: Secret Sharing

The XOR operation is a simple, but effective method for hiding meaning.
It's derived from the identity <code>A = (A ^ B) ^ B</code>.  XOR-ing a
message with a random key provides <em>perfect</em> encryption, known as
a <em>one-time pad</em>. It is essentially the only form of encryption
that is information-theoretically secure, but is impractical for most
purposes since it requires a perfectly-random key as long as the
message and that key can never be reused.

It works by taking in a message and a random bit sequence (key) of equal
length. Each bit in the message is XORed with the corresponding bit in
the key to produce the encrypted message. The original message can then
be recovered by applying the XOR process to the key and the encrypted
message.

For this exercise, we will use this strategy to convert a plaintext file
into two secret shares, each of which discloses no information about the
original file (other than its length), but if someone has both shares
they can put them together to produce the original file.  A paranoid
individual might use such an approach to store a file in the cloud by
storing one share using Dropbox and the other share using Google Docs.
The user could acquire both shares to obtain the file, and if the NSA
can hypothetically (of course) obtain all of the data from one of the
services but not both of them, it would not be enough to learn the
contents of the file.

Note that our implementation uses 
scode
std::rand::random
edoc
to generate the random key.  This is not cryptographically strong randomness, so should be used for entertainment purposes only!  (If you are interested in better random numbers, see <a href="https://github.com/wbkostan/cs4414-ps4">tRustees: True Random Number Generation</a>.)

We'll provide the code to do the splitting, and leave it as
an exercise for you to write the joining code.

phead 3 Splitter

The following Rust code implements the splitter.  It takes as input the
name of a file, and writes out two share files.

scode False {'loc': 'code/splitter.rs', 'lang': 'rust', 'range': False}

phead 4 Joiner

The joiner reverses the splitting process, taking the two shares and combining them to produce the original message.

<div class="exercise"> 

<b>Exercise 2.3.</b> Implement the joiner.  It
should take two file names as its inputs, and output to standard output
the result of XOR-ing the bytes in those files.  The inputs files must be the same length.

</div>

Your joiner should be able to produce the plaintext from the example
files: <a href="http://aml3.github.io/RustTutorial/code/msg.share1">msg.share1</a> and <a href="http://aml3.github.io/RustTutorial/code/msg.share2">msg.share2</a>.  You should download these files (look
at them to confirm they appear to be random bytes).  

Then, try executing:
<pre><code>
joiner msg.share1 msg.share2
</code>
</pre>

If you implemented the joiner correctly, you should see a (somewhat)
