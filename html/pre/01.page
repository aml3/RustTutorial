phead 1 Getting Started: Variables, Functions, and Syntax
In this section, we'll be going over the basic syntax of Rust. You'll learn about
variable declarations and mutability, how to work with functions, and some basic
control flow, like loops, conditionals, and matching. Finally, we'll be analyzing
a simple program to find
