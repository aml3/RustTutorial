Welcome to Rust!

Rust, as per [rust-lang.org](http://www.rust-lang.org), is a multi-paradigm,
C family language with some significant differences in semantics and syntax,
focused on safety and concurrency.
We'll be starting with a quick tour of Rust's syntax, before delving into how
Rust handles pointers and memory, going over some of the more interesting
language features in a little more depth, and finishing up with information
on the most commonly used modules of Rust's prepackaged library.

This tutorial is designed to expand upon and build off of the tutorial offered 
at [rust-lang.org](http://www.rust-lang.org), going in greater depth and 
(optimally) providing a better explanation of certain topics.

If you haven't already installed Rust, that would be a good first step.
