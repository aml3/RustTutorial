Rust's syntax is heavily influenced by C/C++. For example, scope is determined 
by `{` and `}`, and statements end with a `;`. Like other C-family languages, 
whitespace (e.g. tabs and spaces) is ignored by the compiler. 

Unlike C/C++, we create a function using the `fn` keyword.

```rust
fn main()
{
	print("Hello World\n");
}
```

A better example would be something like the following.

```rust
fn main()
{
	let x = get_hello();
	print(x);
}

fn get_hello() -> &str
{
	return "Hello World!";
}
```

Several things are going on in this code. First, variables are declared using 
the `let` keyword. Notice that we didn't have to specify a type, such as `str`.
The Rust compiler can infer types, as long as there isn't any ambiguity. If 
something is ambiguous, a type can be specificied using `variable-name :type`.

```rust
let x = 4; // uses the compiler default
let y: uint = 4; // forces y to be an unsigned integer
let z: i32 = 4; // forces z to be a 32-bit integer
```

Second, we specified a return type using `->`. This is fairly straightforward. 
Any valid type can be returned by a function.

Third, there's a `&` in the return type. This is will discussed in the [third 
section](03.md). The next section deals with the basics of Rust variables and 
syntax.
