Before, we saw that the return type on `get_hello()` was `&str`. 

```rust
fn get_hello() -> &str
{
	return "Hello World!";
}
```

The `&` involves Rust pointers, which revolve around ownership. There are three
different types of pointers: `&`, `~`, and `@`. 

[Ownership](http://static.rust-lang.org/doc/0.8/tutorial.html#ownership) refers
 to which object or section of code a variable belongs to. It's used to deal 
 with variable life-cycles, including garbage collection.

 `~` refers to an owned pointer. Variables allocated with `~` are put on the
 heap. An example from the Rust tutorial demonstrates life-cycles for owned
 pointers.

 ```rust
 {
	 // an integer allocated on the heap
	 let y = ~10; // pointer to `10`
 }
 // the destructor frees the memory heap as soon as `y` goes out of scope
```

Owned pointers can be tricky. Assignment works differently than with plain
variables. Consider this code:

```rust
let x = ~5;
let y = x;
println(format("{:?}", x));
println(format("{:?}", y));
```

Trying to compile gives the error 'use of moved value `x`'. Explicity writing
the types will help this error make more sense.

```rust
let x: ~int = ~5; // pointer to `5`
let y: ~int = x;
println(format("{:?}", x)); // error
println(format("{:?}", y)); // okay
```

What actually happens with the `let y: ~int = x;` is that `y` is set to point 
the same place as `x`. Since this is with owned pointers, and a variable can 
only have a single owned pointer pointing to it at a time, `x` no longer points
to anything valid. (Note, Rust doesn't have an actual `NULL`.)

An way to think of it is that Rust actually moves `x`'s value to `y`. (This 
would be horribly inefficient though. Rust actually just does pointer 
shenanigans.)

As an aside, the following is valid code.

```rust
let x: ~int = ~5;
let y: int = *x; // dereferences, same as C++
println(format("{:?}", x)); // prints `~5`
println(format("{:?}", y)); // prints `5`
```

Owned pointers can be used to make vectors (or other structures) on the heap.

```rust
let a: ~[int] = ~[1, 2, 3];
let b = ~["x", "y", "z"];
```

Passing them to a function counts as moving the value.

```rust
fn main()
{
	let mut nums = ~[1, 2, 3];
	let sum = sum(nums);
	nums.push(4); // error, use of moved value
}

fn sum(array: ~[int]) -> int
{
	let mut sum = 0;
	for x in array.iter()
	{
		sum += *x;
	}
	return sum;
}
```
