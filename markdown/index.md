Welcome to Rust!

Rust, as per [rust-lang.org](http://www.rust-lang.org), is a multi-paradigm,
C family language with some significant differences in semantics and syntax,
focused on safety and concurrency.
We'll be starting with a quick tour of Rust's syntax, before delving into how
Rust handles pointers and memory, going over some of the more interesting
language features in a little more depth, and finishing up with information
on the most commonly used modules of Rust's prepackaged library.
